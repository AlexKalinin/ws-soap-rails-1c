# Simple Ruby on Rails SOAP webservice for integration with 1C:Enterprise 8.x client

Language / язык: **EN** | [RU](README.RUS.md)

##NOTE FOR ENGLISH-SPEAKING
This project was developed mainly for integration with [1C Enterprise 8](http://www.1c.ru/eng/title.htm) system. The writing of code in 1C is fully in russian and 99% for Russian-speaking customers. 1C developers often doesn't know English. That is why I don't see the reason to develope this project in English.
